<h1>MechMania 16 Competition Information</h1>

<p>First, see http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/Conferenceware/Page/MechMania for
information.</p>

<p>The majority of information here is only useful for the actual competition.</p>

<h2>The Arena</h2>

<p>During the competition, you will have the option to submit your client to the
arena. When at least 4 teams are submitted, they will continuously battle, with
new teams added as they are submitted. Updates may be submitted at any time.</p>

<p>The arena determines your starting position into the bracket.</p>

<h2>Final Tournament</h2>

<p>The final tournament will be run using the code submitted to the arena at 9am on
Sunday. The tournament will be run on the same computer as the arena, so make
sure your code works there. Submit early for best results. The arena is running
on a different setup than your lab machines (64 bit Linux in the labs versus 64
bit OS X for the arena).</p>

<p>The final tournament is single (or double?) elimination, with best-of-three
games played at each part of the tournament. This should eliminate the impact
of any random crashes. This is subject to change without notice.</p>

<p>Corporate teams may participate in exhibition matches against student teams but
will not affect the student winner. If possible, a corporate bracket will be run
as well.</p>

<h2>Prizes</h2>

<p>Student teams: A representative from your team must be present at the closing
ceremony to win. We'll want a picture of your team with your prizes, so try to
have everyone there.</p>

<p>Corporate teams: Sorry, you are not eligible for prizes beyond bragging rights.</p>

<h2>Getting Assistance</h2>

<p>During the competition, there will be someone at the front of 0216 (the larger
lab) to answer questions. If there is no one there, then check if someone
wearing a staff shirt is running around the lab frantically, and try waiting up
front.</p>

<p>You will be subscribed to our team discussion list, mm-help <em>AT</em> acm.uiuc.edu.
This is public to all teams. For private matters (especially after the
competition), email mechmania <em>AT</em> acm.uiuc.edu.</p>

<p>We also have an IRC channel. It's "#mechmania16" on irc.freenode.net. The
channel ops are MechMania staff.</p>
