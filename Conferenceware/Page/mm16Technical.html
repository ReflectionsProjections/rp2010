<h2>Running the Server</h2>

<p>There is a "run" script in the server directory. Execute it to run the server.
It takes the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>-p, number of players. Defaults to 1.</li>
<li>-t, number of turns to run. Defaults to 500.</li>
<li>-m, map filename. Defaults to "default.map". Can be any file in the server
maps directory.</li>
<li>-v, verbose. Extended debug information, which may or may not be useful to
you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your client has approximately 10 seconds to connect. Keep this in mind if you
are running them both by hand.</p>

<h2>Running Your Client</h2>

<p>Your client should include a "run.sh" script that takes the following arguments:</p>

<p>run.sh TEAMNAME</p>

<p>A default script is included, so this is unlikely to be a problem.</p>

<p>If you are using the C++ client, you MUST include a Makefile, which will be
executed once when your client is uploaded to the arena. We have included a
Makefile for you; you can modify it, but if you break it, you're on your own.</p>

<p>If you are using the Java client, you MUST include a build.xml file, which will
be executed by your run.sh script. We have included one for you, so this should
not be a problem.</p>

<p>Our arena is set up with a very restricted environment. You have access to
standard libraries, but you won't have access to most other system resources,
but again, this should not be a problem since the defaults work.</p>

<p>When the game concludes, the socket to your client will be closed and you will
probably crash. That's okay. You are not permitted to keep state between runs.</p>
